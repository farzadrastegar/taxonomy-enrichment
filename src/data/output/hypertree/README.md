# FashionBrain Taxonomy

EU project 732328: "Fashion Brain".

D1.3: Fashion Brain Taxonomy

In this repository, we provide a hypertree representation of FashionBrain taxonomy. The FashionBrain taxonomy contains fashion items ordered hierarchically. In order to visualize it, we use one of the hypertree tools offered by [JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit](http://philogb.github.io/jit/). With this animation, we can navigate throughout the taxonomy. For example, by clicking on a node, the tree moves, center that node and displays the centered node's children.

# Getting Started
In order to visualize the FashionBrain taxonomy, first clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/InesArous/Fashion_taxonomy.git
cd ./Visualisation/
open ./Fashion_vis.html 
```

The input data used for this visualization is under the following folder:
```
./Visualisation/data.json
```
